As a user
When I am at the command line inside of a Shopify theme repository

And I am on the master branch

And I type “fly branch my-branch-name”

Then the branch “my-branch-name” is created in git and checked out

And my Shopify shop has a new theme called “my-branch-name” which is a duplicate of the master branch


Checks you are in a master branch?
Checks you are in a shopify theme repository?
Shopify API to get master branch and make a copy and rename copy with new branch name
Serve new theme ID

add option to specify which theme you would like to copy and rename
if no option is provided search for theme with name: "master" or role: "main"

You should basically select what store you want to be working on. And then Shopifly should manage keeping branches / themes in sync within that store. And there should be shortcuts, i.e. fly preview which opens the theme preview in the browser.

` ` to run commands? is there another way?
